Rego6xx
=======

This is a simple tool that read sensor values from Rego6xx controlled heat pumps. The Rego controller module can be found in IVT, Bosch and many more brands.
The tool communicates with Rego using RS232, normally trough a RS232-USB converter. You can either build your own cable or buy one. The Rego controller have a serial port which you'll find inside the heat pump.

**NOTE:** The serial interface is TTL +5 volt so you can't conntect directly to a computers serial port. You must have a level converter or you may damage the interface.

Usage
=====
For example, to read outdoor temperature and see alarm state:

```
rego6xx.py --sensor GT2 --sensor alarm
GT2       = 4.6 C
alarm     = OFF
```

To read compressor temperature from another serial port, change label and print it in Graphite style:

```
rego6xx.py --sensor GT6 --map-name GT6,Compressor --graphite --port /dev/ttyUSB1
Compressor 23.7 1384464007
```

If you have a cron job that is executed regulary you could feed the data direct to Graphite with netcat like this:

```
rego6xx.py --sensor GT2 --map-name GT2,house.temp.outdoor --sensor GT3 --map-name GT3,house.temp.hotwater --sensor GT6 --map-name GT6,house.temp.compressor --graphite | nc -q0 "graphite.logger.com 2003"
```
